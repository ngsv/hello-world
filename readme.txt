Step: Create a New File
Now that you've got a repository started, add a file to it.

Open a text editor. Now write a couple of lines of text, perhaps say hello, and save the file as readme.txt in the 'hello-world' folder you created in the last challenge.

*************************************
Step: Make More Changes
Now add another line to readme.txt and save.

In terminal, you can view the difference between the file now and how it was at your last commit.

$ git diff
